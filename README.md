# Train Power Converter
Welcome to the TrainPowerConverterSim repository! This repository serves as the public gateway to our detailed work on power conversion in electric trains. Here you will find extensive documentation and explanations in our GitHub Wiki.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the following:
- **Detailed Wiki**: Our GitHub Wiki contains comprehensive documentation on the power conversion systems used in electric trains. This includes mathematical models, simulation results, and detailed explanations of the power conversion process.
- **Submodule**: A submodule pointing to the main branch of the private repository `TrainPowerConverterSim_private`, which contains the full report and simulation files.

## Accessing the Private Repository

The private repository `TrainPowerConverterSim_private` contains all the detailed reports and simulation files related to this project. If you have access to the private repository, you can clone this public repository along with its submodule using the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EngrIbrahimAdnan/TrainPowerConverterSim.git
```

If you have already cloned the repository without the `--recurse-submodules` flag, you can initialize and update the submodule using:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Wiki**: Navigate to the Wiki section of this repository to read through the documentation. The Wiki contains all the necessary information about the power conversion process, including theoretical background, equations, and simulation results.
2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have access to the private repository, follow the instructions above to clone the repository with its submodule. This will give you access to the full report and simulation files.
